                                  Congress party is going into a huddle at the
                                  three-day Nav Sankalp Chintan Shivir in
                                  Udaipur. The Chintan Shivir is the fourth such
                                  conglomeration held by Congress since 1998.
                                  The last Shivir happened in 2013, wherein
                                  Rahul Gandhi was anointed as the Vice
                                  President.

                                <p>
                                  The Shivir is happening at a time when the
                                  party lost badly in Punjab where it was the
                                  incumbent. It failed to form a government in
                                  the other four states, Goa, Uttar Pradesh,
                                  Uttarakhand, and Manipur, that went to the
                                  polls.

                                  the Shivir, it hopes to set a revival path for
                                  its dwindling electoral presence.

                                      unanimity on the âOne Family, One Ticketâ
                                      rule. However, the rule is not absolute.
                                      For anyone else from the same family to
                                      seek a party ticket, they must work within
                                      the organisation for at least five years.

                                  Post-2019 general elections, Congress has lost
                                  three States to BJP, bringing its tally down
                                  to two.
                                </p>

                                      It is fast surrendering its vote bank to
                                      AAP, a 10-year old party that is
                                      projecting itself as a national
                                      alternative.

                                      Congress-ruled Delhi for 15 years before
                                      it relinquished its vote base to AAP.
                                    </p>

                                      In Punjab, too, AAP has replaced Congress.
                                      The former is now eyeing Gujarat to emerge
                                      as a direct challenger to the ruling BJP,
                                      replacing Congress in the opposition.
                                    </p>

                                      Earlier Congress would be seen as a
                                      natural leader in bringing together an
                                      anti-BJP alliance. However, not anymore.
                                      It is now being seen as a burden than a
                                      leading ally.

                                  <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Congressâs
                                  Chintan Shivir is completely mute on the point
                                  of leadership, yet. Despite many attempts by
                                  the party to reinvent Rahul Gandhi in peopleâs
                                  eyes, they have not been able to salvage its
                                  electoral fortunes. Yet, the issue of
                                  leadership is not open for deliberation. So,
                                  it is left to be seen how much of the
                                  structural tinkering could lead to Congressâs
                                  revival.

                                  A huge crowd gathered at a protest rally led

                                  president K Annamalai at Tiruvarur. He was
                                  demonstrating against the renaming of
                                  Tiruvarur â Thiyagarajar temple car

                                  Karunanidhi, by the state government.

                                  Tiruvarur is the native town of Karunanidhi,
                                  and a DMK bastion.

                                      The massive crowd for the BJP state
                                      presidentâs rally in Tiruvarur should
                                      raise alarm bells in the DMK. The ruling
                                      party has been trying to target Hindu
                                      temples and institutions in the state and
                                      is seeing forceful protests by the BJP.

                                      A few days back, the ruling party tried to
                                      ban a 500-year-old ritual conducted by
                                      Dharmapuram Adheenam. It had to revoke its
                                      ban, within days, after a strong protest.

                                  In a tweet, he said that the Chief Minister of

                                  roads to villages of Tamil Nadu instead.

                                  On the same day, a youngster, Manikandan from
                                  Nannilam in Tiruvarur district, committed
                                  suicide after he was allegedly asked to pay a
                                  bribe to officials to release funds under the
                                  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna.

                                  <strong>Bottom line:</strong> The outpouring
                                  of a massive crowd, that too, at the ruling
                                  partyâs bastion must make the state government
                                  think. The BJP state unit has been raising the
                                  pitch and trying to mobilise public anger
                                  against the anti-Hindu policies of the DMK
                                  government.

                                  Congress party is going into a huddle at the
                                  three-day Nav Sankalp Chintan Shivir in
                                  Udaipur. The Chintan Shivir is the fourth such
                                  conglomeration held by Congress since 1998.
                                  The last Shivir happened in 2013, wherein
                                  Rahul Gandhi was anointed as the Vice
                                  President.

                                <p>
                                  The Shivir is happening at a time when the
                                  party lost badly in Punjab where it was the
                                  incumbent. It failed to form a government in
                                  the other four states, Goa, Uttar Pradesh,
                                  Uttarakhand, and Manipur, that went to the
                                  polls.

                                  <strong>Points of Discussion: </strong>During
                                  the Shivir, it hopes to set a revival path for
                                  its dwindling electoral presence.

                                      The party spokesperson, Ajay Maken, in a
                                      press conference said that there is near
                                      unanimity on the âOne Family, One Ticketâ
                                      rule. However, the rule is not absolute.
                                      For anyone else from the same family to
                                      seek a party ticket, they must work within
                                      the organisation for at least five years.

                                  Post-2019 general elections, Congress has lost
                                  three States to BJP, bringing its tally down
                                  to two.

                                      It is fast surrendering its vote bank to
                                      AAP, a 10-year old party that is
                                      projecting itself as a national

                                      it relinquished its vote base to AAP.

                                      In Punjab, too, AAP has replaced Congress.
                                      The former is now eyeing Gujarat to emerge
                                      as a direct challenger to the ruling BJP,
                                      replacing Congress in the opposition.

                                      Earlier Congress would be seen as a
                                      natural leader in bringing together an
                                      anti-BJP alliance. However, not anymore.
                                      It is now being seen as a burden than a
                                      leading ally.

                                  <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Congressâs
                                  Chintan Shivir is completely mute on the point
                                  of leadership, yet. Despite many attempts by
                                  the party to reinvent Rahul Gandhi in peopleâs
                                  eyes, they have not been able to salvage its
                                  electoral fortunes. Yet, the issue of
                                  leadership is not open for deliberation. So,
                                  it is left to be seen how much of the
                                  structural tinkering could lead to Congressâs
                                  revival.

                                      A few days back, the ruling party tried to
                                      ban a 500-year-old ritual conducted by
                                      Dharmapuram Adheenam. It had to revoke its
                                      ban, within days, after a strong protest.

                                  On the same day, a youngster, Manikandan from
                                  Nannilam in Tiruvarur district, committed
                                  suicide after he was allegedly asked to pay a
                                  bribe to officials to release funds under the
                                  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna.

                                  <strong>Bottom line:</strong> The outpouring
                                  of a massive crowd, that too, at the ruling
                                  partyâs bastion must make the state government
                                  think. The BJP state unit has been raising the
                                  pitch and trying to mobilise public anger
                                  against the anti-Hindu policies of the DMK
                                  government.
